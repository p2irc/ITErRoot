# Exiftool
Exiftool was used to move around tiff images and inspect metadata.  There is no easy way to install the python library, so the whole library is copied here.

Note to future Kyle and anyone interested.  Apparently git allows submodules, which let you add a git repository as a folder inside a git repository.  This is nice because you get a copy of the library, but any updates to it will be applied to your project if you pull them.  Might be more robust than simply copying the libraries.
