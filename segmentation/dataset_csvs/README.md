# dataset_csvs
This folder contains `.csv` files that tell which full images were used to create the patch datasets for training the segmentation network. These can be used with the patch generation scripts in `data_utils` to generate a patch dataset for training, testing, and evaluation.

You will need to replace the paths to the images with an appropriate path on your machine.
